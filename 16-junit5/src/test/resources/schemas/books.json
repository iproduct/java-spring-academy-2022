        "description": "Software testing is indispensable and is one of the most discussed topics in software development today. Many companies address this issue by assigning a dedicated software testing phase towards the end of their development cycle. However, quality cannot be tested into a buggy application. Early and continuous unit testing has been shown to be crucial for high quality software and low defect rates. Yet current books on testing ignore the developer's point of view and give little guidance on how to bring the overwhelming amount of testing theory into practice. Unit Testing in Java represents a practical introduction to unit testing for software developers. It introduces the basic test-first approach and then discusses a large number of special issues and problem cases. The book instructs developers through each step and motivates them to explore further. Shows how the discovery and avoidance of software errors is a demanding and creative activity in its own right and can build confidence early in a project. Demonstrates how automated tests can detect the unwanted effects of small changes in code within the entire system. Discusses how testing works with persistency, concurrency, distribution, and web applications. Includes a discussion of testing with C++ and Smalltalk.",

        "description": "Enterprise Java developers must achieve broader, deeper test coverage, going beyond unit testing to implement functional and integration testing with systematic acceptance. Next Generation Java™ Testing introduces breakthrough Java testing techniques and TestNG, a powerful open source Java testing platform. Cédric Beust, TestNG's creator, and leading Java developer Hani Suleiman, present powerful, flexible testing patterns that will work with virtually any testing tool, framework, or language. They show how to leverage key Java platform improvements designed to facilitate effective testing, such as dependency injection and mock objects. They also thoroughly introduce TestNG, demonstrating how it overcomes the limitations of older frameworks and enables new techniques, making it far easier to test today's complex software systems. Pragmatic and results-focused, Next Generation Java™ Testing will help Java developers build more robust code for today's mission-critical environments. This book Illuminates the tradeoffs associated with testing, so you can make better decisions about what and how to test Introduces TestNG, explains its goals and features, and shows how to apply them in real-world environments Shows how to integrate TestNG with your existing code, development frameworks, and software libraries Demonstrates how to test crucial code features, such as encapsulation, state sharing, scopes, and thread safety Shows how to test application elements, including JavaEE APIs, databases, Web pages, and XML files Presents advanced techniques: testing partial failures, factories, dependent testing, remote invocation, cluster-based test farms, and more Walks through installing and using TestNG plug-ins for Eclipse, and IDEA Contains extensive code examples Whether you use TestNG, JUnit, or another testing framework, the testing design patterns presented in this book will show you how to improve your tests by giving you concrete advice on how to make your code and your design more testable.",

Freshly updated for modern software development, Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 With JUnit teaches you how to write and run easily maintained unit tests in JUnit with confidence. You'll learn mnemonics to help you know what tests to write, how to remember all the boundary conditions, and what the qualities of a good test are. You'll see how unit tests can pay off by allowing you to keep your system code clean, and you'll learn how to handle the stuff that seems too tough to test. Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 With JUnit steps you through all the important unit testing topics. If you've never written a unit test, you'll see screen shots from Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans that will help you get past the hard part--getting set up and started. Once past the basics, you'll learn why you want to write unit tests and how to effectively use JUnit. But the meaty part of the book is its collected unit testing wisdom from people who've been there, done that on production systems for at least 15 years: veteran author and developer Jeff Langr, building on the wisdom of Pragmatic Programmers Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. You'll learn: How to craft your unit tests to minimize your effort in maintaining them. How to use unit tests to help keep your system clean. How to test the tough stuff. Memorable mnemonics to help you remember what's important when writing unit tests. How to help your team reap and sustain the benefits of unit testing. You won't just learn about unit testing in theory--you'll work through numerous code examples. When it comes to programming, hands-on is the only way to learn!",

The test automation theme is firstly placed firmly within the overall QA activity on a typical project, prior to describing some of the usual reasons why automation fails and how the presented pattern of solution addresses these failures.Along with copious illustrations, there is a wealth of \"code\" that is available for download (www.dexters-defect-dungeon.com).

        "description": "Software testing is indispensable and is one of the most discussed topics in software development today. Many companies address this issue by assigning a dedicated software testing phase towards the end of their development cycle. However, quality cannot be tested into a buggy application. Early and continuous unit testing has been shown to be crucial for high quality software and low defect rates. Yet current books on testing ignore the developer's point of view and give little guidance on how to bring the overwhelming amount of testing theory into practice. Unit Testing in Java represents a practical introduction to unit testing for software developers. It introduces the basic test-first approach and then discusses a large number of special issues and problem cases. The book instructs developers through each step and motivates them to explore further. Shows how the discovery and avoidance of software errors is a demanding and creative activity in its own right and can build confidence early in a project. Demonstrates how automated tests can detect the unwanted effects of small changes in code within the entire system. Discusses how testing works with persistency, concurrency, distribution, and web applications. Includes a discussion of testing with C++ and Smalltalk.",

You'll learn mnemonics to help you know what tests to write, how to remember all the boundary conditions, and what the qualities of a good test are. You'll see how unit tests can pay off by allowing you to keep your system code clean, and you'll learn how to handle the stuff that seems too tough to test. Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 With JUnit steps you through all the important unit testing topics. If you've never written a unit test, you'll see screen shots from Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans that will help you get past the hard part--getting set up and started. Once past the basics, you'll learn why you want to write unit tests and how to effectively use JUnit. But the meaty part of the book is its collected unit testing wisdom from people who've been there, done that on production systems for at least 15 years: veteran author and developer Jeff Langr, building on the wisdom of Pragmatic Programmers Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. You'll learn: How to craft your unit tests to minimize your effort in maintaining them. How to use unit tests to help keep your system clean. How to test the tough stuff. Memorable mnemonics to help you remember what's important when writing unit tests. How to help your team reap and sustain the benefits of unit testing. You won't just learn about unit testing in theory--you'll work through numerous code examples. When it comes to programming, hands-on is the only way to learn!",

You'll work with a microservice environment built using Java EE, WildFly Swarm, and Docker. You'll learn how to increase your test coverage and productivity, and gain confidence that your system will work as you expect. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Microservice applications present special testing challenges. Even simple services need to handle unpredictable loads, and distributed message-based designs pose unique security and performance concerns. These challenges increase when you throw in asynchronous communication and containers. About the Book Testing Java Microservices teaches you to implement unit and integration tests for microservice systems running on the JVM. You'll work with a microservice environment built using Java EE, WildFly Swarm, and Docker. You'll advance from writing simple unit tests for individual services to more-advanced practices like chaos or integration tests. As you move towards a continuous-delivery pipeline, you'll also master live system testing using technologies like the Arquillian, Wiremock, and Mockito frameworks, along with techniques like contract testing and over-the-wire service virtualization. Master these microservice-specific practices and tools and you'll greatly increase your test coverage and productivity, and gain confidence that your system will work as you expect. What's Inside Test automation Integration testing microservice systems Testing container-centric systems Service virtualization About the Reader Written for Java developers familiar with Java EE, EE4J, Spring, or Spring Boot. About the Authors Alex Soto Bueno and Jason Porter are Arquillian team members. Andy Gumbrecht is an Apache TomEE developer and PMC. They all have extensive enterprise-testing experience.

        "description": "Formal methods provide system designers with the possibility to analyze system models and reason about them with mathematical precision and rigor. The use of formal methods is not restricted to the early development phases of a system, though. The di?erent testing phases can also bene?t from them to ease the p- duction and application of e?ective and e?cient tests. Many still regard formal methods and testing as an odd combination. Formal methods traditionally aim at verifying and proving correctness (a typical academic activity), while testing shows only the presence of errors (this is what practitioners do). Nonetheless, there is an increasing interest in the use of formal methods in software testing. It is expected that formal approaches are about to make a major impact on eme- ing testing technologies and practices. Testing proves to be a good starting point for introducing formal methods in the software development process. This volume contains the papers presented at the 3rd Workshop on Formal Approaches to Testing of Software, FATES 2003, that was in a?liation with the IEEE/ACM Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2003). This year, FATES received 43 submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least three independent reviewers from the program committee with the help of - ditional reviewers. Based on their evaluations, 18 papers submitted by authors from 13 di?erent countries were selected for presentation at the workshop.",

        "description": "Summary Effective Unit Testing is written to show how to write good tests—tests that are concise and to the point, expressive, useful, and maintainable. Inspired by Roy Osherove's bestselling The Art of Unit Testing, this book focuses on tools and practices specific to the Java world. It introduces you to emerging techniques like behavior-driven development and specification by example, and shows you how to add robust practices into your toolkit. About Testing Test the components before you assemble them into a full application, and you'll get better software. For Java developers, there's now a decade of experience with well-crafted tests that anticipate problems, identify known and unknown dependencies in the code, and allow you to test components both in isolation and in the context of a full application. About this Book Effective Unit Testing teaches Java developers how to write unit tests that are concise, expressive, useful, and maintainable. Offering crisp explanations and easy-to-absorb examples, it introduces emerging techniques like behavior-driven development and specification by example. Programmers who are already unit testing will learn the current state of the art. Those who are new to the game will learn practices that will serve them well for the rest of their career. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book. About the Author Lasse Koskela is a coach, trainer, consultant, and programmer. He hacks on open source projects, helps companies improve their productivity, and speaks frequently at conferences around the world. Lasse is the author of Test Driven, also published by Manning.
